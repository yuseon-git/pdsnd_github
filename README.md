### Project Title
I named this project "Let's explore US Bikeshare Data".
This name reveals exactly what this project can present to you.

### Description
In this project, you can find out bikeshare usage patterns in three cities in the US.
These three cities are Chicago, New York City  and Washington.
If you give a name of the city, a month and a day, we will show you the result accordingly.

Some examples of the information that you can find out are:

the most frequent times of travel
the most popular trip based on a start station and an end station
the average trip duration
the status of the user types (and in case of New York City and Chicago) user ages
