### Date created
This project was created on 2nd August, 2020.

### Project Title
I named this project "Let's explore US Bikeshare Data".
This name reveals exactly what this project can present to you.

### Description
In this project, you can find out bikeshare usage patterns in three cities in the US.
These three cities are Chicago, New York City  and Washington.
If you give a name of the city, a month and a day, we will show you the result accordingly.

Some examples of the information that you can find out are:

the most frequent times of travel
the most popular trip based on a start station and an end station
the average trip duration
the status of the user types (and in case of New York City and Chicago) user ages  

### Files used
Following files were used in this project:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.
